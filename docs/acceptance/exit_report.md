## Executive Overview

## Project Results


We obtained an overall r2_score of 0.63 when implementing the XGBoost regressor, compared to the 
Random Forest regressor, which obtained an optimized r2_score of 0.42. After careful experimentation, we can conclude
that the XGBoost regressors, thanks to its iterable learning process, had a significantly better performance when predicting changes in average temperature due to agri-industrial activities. 
However, there is still some unknown variation that contributes to the average change in temperature that may be related 
to other industrial activities and should be added to the present study. All in all, this study is a step ahead in 
understanding the complex relationship between anthropogenic activities and the current global warming trend that has 
affected a wide range of ecological processes and needs urgent attention from both the scientific community and decision-makers around the world. 

## Lessons Learned

- One of the main challenges during the project was to carry through the hyperparameter experimentation, as these parameters are mathematically elusive, which makes them quite difficult to interpret.  
- One important lesson learned through this study was to employ a concise architecture designed at the beginning of the project, which enabled us to better forecast possible challenges and have a systematic approach during the entire process. 
- One main recommendation for future ML projects is to spend more time during the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) stage, as this stage is crucial for any Data Analysis project and might prevent further misinterpretations when implementing the models.

## Project Impact

- This study has a primarily academic focus, however, is an interesting exploration to have an insight into how significant agro-industrial activities are in affecting the average increase in temperature globally.     
- Consider further scientific publications regarding the topic, as possible challenges could have been prevented or perhaps, more robust and systematic methodologies would be applied through the present study.   

## Conclusions

- The global performance of the implemented model and after careful experimentation, considering all the limitations -  in terms of available data and the heterogeneity of available information - is about 63% (r2_score), meaning that the records regarding agro-industrial activities could considerably explain the temperature variation given these type of activities. This latter may be considered an important alarm to focus our attention on how we produce, consume, and distribute the food we eat worldwide, and ultimately, as final consumers, enhance awareness regarding the environmental impact of the food we choose to place on our tables, particularly in terms of CO2 emissions
