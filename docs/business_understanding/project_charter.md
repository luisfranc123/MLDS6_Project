# Project Charter - Business Understanding

## Name of the Project

Agricultural Effects on Atmospheric CO2 Emissions  

## Project Objective

The aim of the present applied project is to explore the effects of distinct agricultural activities on CO2 emissions by implementing ML-based approaches to forecasting an increase in average temperature across different geographic places around the world, given the widely-known greenhouse effects of CO2 in the atmosphere.   
The dataset used during this applied project has been constructed by merging and reprocessing up to a dozen individual datasets from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

## Project Scope

- Dataset Description: As mentioned before, the Agri-food CO2 Dataset is an effort to present comprehensive and cohesive information for enthusiasts and professionals who are interested in understanding and addressing the environmental impact of the agri-food industry as a crucial tool for mitigating climate change and developing more sustainable practices within this economic sector.

**DataSet Features**:
| Feature | Description | 
|------|---------|
| **Savannah fires** | Emissions from fires in savanna ecosystems. |
| **Forest fires** | Emissions from fires in forested areas. |
| **Crop Residues** | Emissions from burning or decomposing leftover plant material after crop harvesting. | 
| **Rice Cultivation** | Emissions from methane released during rice cultivation. |
| **Drained organic soils (CO2)** | Emissions from carbon dioxide released when draining organic soils. | 
| **Pesticides Manufacturing** | Emissions from the production of pesticides. |
| **Food Transport** | Emissions from transporting food products. |
| **Forestland** | Land covered by forests. |
| **Net Forest conversion** | Change in forest area due to forestation and afforestation. |
| **Food Household Consumption** | Emissions from food consumption at the household level. |
| **Food Retail** | Emissions from the operation of retail establishments selling food. |
| **On-farm Electricity Use** | Electricity consumption on farms. | 
| **Food Packaging** | Emissions from the production and disposal of food packaging materials.|
| **Agrifood Systems Waste Disposal** | Emissions from waste disposal in the agrifood system. |
| **Food Processing** | Emissions from processing food products. |
| **Fertilizers Manufacturing** | Emissions from the production of fertilizers. |
| **IPPU** | Emissions from industrial processes and product use. |
| **Manure applied to soils** | Emissions from applying animal manure to agricultural soils. |
| **Manure left on Pasture** | Emissions from animal manure on pasture or grazing land. |
| **Manure Management** | Emissions from managing and treating animal manure. |
| **Fires in organic soils** | Emissions from fires in organic soils. | 
| **Fires in humid tropical forests** | Emissions from fires in humid tropical forests. |
| **On-farm energy use** | Energy consumption on farms. | 
| **Rural population** | Number of people living in rural areas. | 
| **Urban population** | Number of people living in urban areas. | 
| **Total population - Male** | Total number of male individuals in the population. | 
| **Total population - Female** | Total number of female individuals in the population. |
| **total_emission** | Total greenhouse gas emissions from various sources | 
| **Average Temperature °C** | The average increase of temperature (by year) in degrees Celsius. | 

- Description of Expected Results: By employing a CRISP-DM methodology, we want to explore which are the main agri-food industry activities that significantly contribute to an increase in the average temperature, and thus, propose a technical-based caveat to identify possible targets in which our efforts to mitigate current climate change trends might be focused on.
  
-  Project Success Criteria: *i)* Share and open source code and methodologies used during our analyses, *ii)* Implement robust statistical analysis before reaching any conclusion, *iii)* Follow a well-defined methodology (CRISP-DM) to present the results and conclusions, *iv)* if possible, establish more than one iteration through the project stages to identify possible improvements that can be made throughout the whole applied project.  

### Excludes:

- The present study excludes any political and ideological affiliation and only pretends to explore a set of available data to apply some of the concepts covered during the advanced certificate course in Machine Learning and Data Science offered by **La Universidad Nacional de Colombia**.   

## Methodology

We will implement the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) methodology, which is a widely used implementation for Machine Learning projects that enable us to predefine each of the working stages within the applied project.
