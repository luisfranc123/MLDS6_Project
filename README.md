# Applied Project in Machine Learning and Data Science (MLDS)_ Universidad Nacional de Colombia

This project template contains the main stages of an applied project in ML. The current study aims to implement an ML-based approach to predict the increase of average temperature globally due to distinct agro-industrial activities.  

This Template contains the following structure: 

* `src`: Implemented code of the project in Python.
* `docs`: Folder containing the project documentation following a CRISP-DM methodology. 
* `scripts`: Folder containing the Python scripts to execute all the project stages. 
* `pyproject.toml`: Project definition.

  **Note:** During the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) stage, there were some graphs created which were stored in doc/Images_EDA, following the same name given within the EDA script.
